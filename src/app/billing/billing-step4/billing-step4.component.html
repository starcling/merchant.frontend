    <label class="titleContent">
      Every time a new customer subscribes to a billing model, the system creates a new PullPayment account. The
      PullPayment account will continuously bill the customer according to the billing modelâ€™s parameters. The PMA
      tokens will be kept in the PullPayment account until they are transferred to the Treasury.

    <label class="titleContent"
      >Choose how often you want to transfer funds from all the PullPayment accounts associated with this billing model
      to your Treasury. Depending on your choice, the specific amount of ETH is allocated for those recurring payments
      to pay for the gas fees of the transfer to the Treasury.
